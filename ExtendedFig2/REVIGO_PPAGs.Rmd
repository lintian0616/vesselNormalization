### Cleaning PPAGs Dataframe

```{r}
one.data <- data.frame(revigo.data)
names(one.data) <- revigo.names
one.data <- one.data[(one.data$plot_X != "null" & one.data$plot_Y != "null"), ]
one.data$plot_X <- as.numeric( as.character(one.data$plot_X))
one.data$plot_Y <- as.numeric( as.character(one.data$plot_Y))
one.data$plot_size <- as.numeric( as.character(one.data$plot_size))
one.data$log10_p_value <- as.numeric( as.character(one.data$log10_p_value))
one.data$frequency <- as.numeric( as.character(one.data$frequency))
one.data$uniqueness <- as.numeric( as.character(one.data$uniqueness))
one.data$dispensability <- as.numeric( as.character(one.data$dispensability))

select_term <- c("monocyte differentiation", "biological adhesion", "regulation of cell adhesion", "nuclear import", "response to hypoxia", "extracellular matrix disassembly", "axon guidance", "cell morphogenesis")
ex <- one.data[one.data$description %in% select_term, ]
```

### Make Plot for PPAGs

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data=one.data)
p1 <- p1 + geom_point(aes( plot_X, plot_Y, colour=log10_p_value, size=plot_size), alpha=I(0.8))
p1 <- p1 + scale_colour_gradientn(colours=c("blue", "green", "yellow", "red"), limits=c(min(one.data$log10_p_value), max(one.data$log10_p_value)))
p1 <- p1 + geom_point(aes(plot_X, plot_Y, size=plot_size), shape=21, fill="transparent", colour=I(alpha ("black", 0.6)))
p1 <- p1 + scale_size(range=c(5, 25)) + theme_bw()
p1 <- p1 + geom_text(data=ex, aes(plot_X, plot_Y, label=description))
p1 <- p1 + labs (y = "semantic space x", x = "semantic space y")
p1 <- p1 + theme(legend.key=element_blank())
one.x_range <- max(one.data$plot_X) - min(one.data$plot_X)
one.y_range <- max(one.data$plot_Y) - min(one.data$plot_Y)
p1 <- p1 + xlim(min(one.data$plot_X)-one.x_range/10,max(one.data$plot_X)+one.x_range/10)
p1 <- p1 + ylim(min(one.data$plot_Y)-one.y_range/10,max(one.data$plot_Y)+one.y_range/10)
p1
ggsave(plot=p1, filename="~/projects/thesisDefense/REVIGO/revigo-plot-badAng.pdf", width=7.86,height=6.18, units="in")
```
