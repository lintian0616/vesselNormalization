In the manuscript, we use dot plot to show the results of immuno-fluorescence (IF) staining. The **small dots** represent the value of one field, and the **big circles** that are outlined are the mean value of all the fields in animals. *P* values are calculated by comparing between animals.

We will use the source data in **Fig. 2c** as example. The source data for **Fig. 2c** can be downloaded from online version article. This source data are also saved as **CD31_NG2.csv** in this directory (`~/vesselNormalization/IF_Visualization`). In this **csv** file, the 1st column is **Strain**; the 2nd column is **Mouse/Animal Number**; the 3rd column is **Field Number**, for each animal, we sampled 5 random/independent areas; the 4th column is the parameter of interested.

**Fig2c.Rmd** is the code used to generate **Fig. 2c**.

The output plot is shown below.
