**ORA** is the over-representative analysis of GPAGs and PPAGs, which contains the enriched pathways related with GPAGs and PPAGs. We use [KOBAS](http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn/) to perform **ORA**. This corresponds to **Fig. 1c**.

**METABRIC_Dis_GPAGs_GObp_10000.zip** is the *g*ene *s*et *e*nrichment *a*nalysis (GSEA) output for **Fig. 1d, e**, and **Supplementary Table 3**.
