### Cleaning GPAGs Dataframe

```{r}
one.data <- data.frame(revigo.data)
names(one.data) <- revigo.names
one.data <- one.data[(one.data$plot_X != "null" & one.data$plot_Y != "null"), ]

one.data$uniqueness <- as.numeric( as.character(one.data$uniqueness))

```

### Make Plot for GPAGs

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data=one.data)
p1 <- p1 + geom_point(aes( plot_X, plot_Y, colour=log10_p_value, size=plot_size), alpha=I(0.8))

p1 <- p1 + geom_point(aes(plot_X, plot_Y, size=plot_size), shape=21, fill="transparent", colour=I(alpha ("black", 0.6)))
p1 <- p1 + scale_size(range=c(5, 25)) + theme_bw()
p1 <- p1 + geom_text(data=ex, aes(plot_X, plot_Y, label=description))
p1 <- p1 + labs (y = "semantic space x", x = "semantic space y")
p1 <- p1 + theme(legend.key=element_blank())
